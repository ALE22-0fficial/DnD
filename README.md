### Rest of the Character Sheet

* Proficiency Bonus
	- See character class page
	- Add this bonus whenever you roll for a skill for which you have proficiency
* Hit Dice
	- See class page; put in big box?
	- Use in day to restore HP through REST. Spend a hit die, roll the hit die or take average, add to HP. //TODO: Long rest will refresh the die.
* Hit Points
	How HP Works: life total, 0 means unconscious, -10 is death.
	- Maximum: (Hit Dice) + Constitution Modifier

	- On Level Up: roll your hit die, add constitution modifier, add to previous HP
* Speed

		- Damage / Type: see Equipment page = die + STR-mod // damage type (e.g. "slashing, fire, acid, peircing")
		- In combat, Resistance comes into play: take half dmg; vulnerability: take more -- from the damage type 
	* Defense and Misc. goes in EQUIPMENT BOX
