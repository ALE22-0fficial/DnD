## Character Creation

### Choose a Race
* +/- Ability scores
* Speed
* Proficiencies
* Traits
* Languages

### Choose a Class
* +/- Ability scores
* Note your primary stat for (3)

### Ability Scores
* Roll/point buy/point array to generate 6 random numbers <= 18
* Adjust with the +/- from (1) and (2)
	- Write in the small box
* MODIFIERS
	* These are the +/- you add to your rolls for attacks, ability checks, saving throws, etc. Write in big box.

```
Modifier Calculator = floor( (AS - 10) / 2 )
```

### Lore
* Name!
* Make a rich backstory: where they came from, where they're going, what makes them tick, defining events, personality traits, beliefs
* Choose Background
	- I don't use the Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, Flaws -- I leave it to you.
	- Add Skills Proficiencies
	- Add Equipment
	- Add Traits
* Alignment

### Rest of the Character Sheet
* Inspiration
	- Token points, given to players by DM at DM's discretion for really good roleplay. PCs can then spend this point to aid them in diong ingenious shit (e.g. need to get out of handcuffs blindfolded). 
* Proficiency Bonus
	- See character class page
	- Add this bonus whenever you roll for a skill for which you have proficiency
* Hit Dice
	- See class page; put in big box?
	- Use in day to restore HP through REST. Spend a hit die, roll the hit die or take average, add to HP. *//TODO: Long rest will refresh the die.*
* Hit Points
	How HP Works: life total, 0 means unconscious, -10 is death.
	- Maximum: (Hit Dice) + Constitution Modifier
	- Bigger box is for your current HP
	- On Level Up: roll your hit die, add constitution modifier, add to previous HP
* Speed
	- See race
* Saving Throws
	- See class for which ST you have proficiency in
	- Tick those boxes; for the proficient, write down the relevant modifier + proficiency; otherwise write just the modifier
	- Add the bonus of the relevant ability when you roll ST
* Skills
	- See class, each class has a list of skills to choose from; CHOOSE X, where X is from sheet, OR 2
		. Add proficiency and the relevant A-Mod
* Proficiency
	- See class
* Equipment
	* Attacking equipment goes in ATTACK BOX
		- Can do gold-equipment-buy or use starting/recommended sets
		- ATK Bonus = STR-Mod + [Proficiency]
		- Damage / Type: see Equipment page = die + STR-mod // damage type (e.g. "slashing, fire, acid, peircing")
		- In combat, Resistance comes into play: take half dmg; vulnerability: take more -- from the damage type 
	* Defense and Misc. goes in EQUIPMENT BOX
* Armor Class
	* 10 + Armor + Shield + [DEX]
		- if Light Armor: DEX-mod 
		- elif Medium Armor: max(DEX-mod, 2) 
		- elif Heavy Armor: 0, regardless of DEX
	- *//TODO: can affect disadvantage in stealth*
* Passive Perception
	= 10 + WIS-mod
* Initiative
	= DEX-mod
	* This is added onto the initiative roll, i.e. rolling for initiative is a DEX-check. 

## Spellcasting
Spell Save Check = 8 + Proficency + Relevant modifier bonus
