	* I take relevant equipment and traits, but I don't use the Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, Flaws -- I leave it to you.

### Rest of the Character Sheet
a. Inspiration
	- Token points, given to players by DM at DM's discretion for really good roleplay. PCs can then spend this point to aid them in diong ingenious shit (e.g. need to get out of handcuffs blindfolded). 
b. Proficiency Bonus
	- See character class page
	- Add this bonus whenever you roll for a skill for which you have proficiency
c. Hit Dice
	- See class page; put in big box?
	- Use in day to restore HP through REST. Spend a hit die, roll the hit die or take average, add to HP. //TODO: Long rest will refresh the die.
d. Hit Points
	How HP Works: life total, 0 means unconscious, -10 is death.
	- Maximum: (Hit Dice) + Constitution Modifier
	- Bigger box is for your current HP
	- On Level Up: roll your hit die, add constitution modifier, add to previous HP
